        "Answer": "According to the WHO, a pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease. \"A pandemic is when an epidemic spreads between countries”.\nThere are some other closely related terms that might be helpful :\n- Sporadic: When a disease occurs infrequently and irregularly.\n- Endemic: A constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infection within a geographic area. (Hyperendemic is a situation in which there are persistent, high levels of disease occurrence.)\n- Epidemic: A sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease—more than what's typically expected for the population in that area.\n- Pandemic: An epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, affecting a large number of people.",

        "Answer": "Bacteria\nBacteria are single-celled microorganisms that thrive in many different types of environments. Some varieties live in extremes of cold or heat. Others make their home in people's intestines, where they help digest food. Most bacteria cause no harm to people, but there are exceptions.\nInfections caused by bacteria include:\n- Strep throat\n- Tuberculosis\n- Urinary tract infections\nInappropriate use of antibiotics has helped create bacterial diseases that are resistant to treatment with different types of antibiotic medications.\n\nViruses\nViruses are even smaller than bacteria and require living hosts  such as people, plants or animals to multiply. Otherwise, they can't survive. When a virus enters your body, it invades some of your cells and takes over the cell machinery, redirecting it to produce the virus.\nDiseases caused by viruses include:\n- Chickenpox\n- AIDS\n- Common colds\nIn some cases, it may be difficult to determine whether a bacterium or a virus is causing your symptoms. Many ailments  such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhea can be caused by either bacteria or viruses.",

Finally, if you attended an event where someone sitting at the other side of the room later became sick, you self-monitor.\n\nIf you are an asymptomatic carrier, you show no signs of illness, yet you can pass on the virus to others. This is to be distinguished from an incubatory carrier, who transmits pathogens immediately following infection but prior to developing symptoms.",

COVID-19 the disease is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. \nViruses, and the diseases they cause, often have different names.  For example, HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  People often know the name of a disease, such as measles, but not the name of the virus that causes it (rubeola).\n\nThere are different processes, and purposes, for naming viruses and diseases.\n\nViruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).",

Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). The sample is delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test. The number of tests and testing sites available are rapidly increasing. Still, it will take weeks before the test is available to everyone who may be infected. Meanwhile, clinicians will primarily test those with respiratory symptoms who have recently traveled to certain countries, live in a community with many infected people, or likely have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19.\nCall the State Helpline Number or Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India's 24x7 helpline 011-2397 8046.\nIf one qualifies as a case for testing as per the protocol, they would be tested at a Government approved lab only.",

Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.\n- It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n- In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.",

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",

        "Intent": "procedure",
        "Answer": "You should take many of the same precautions as you would if you were caring for someone with the flu:\r\n\r\n-   Stay in another room or be separated from the person as much as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.\r\n    \r\n-   Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow. Turn on an air conditioner or open a window.\r\n    \r\n-   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Use soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.\r\n    \r\n-   Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\r\n    \r\n-   You and the person should wear a face mask if you are in the same room.\r\n    \r\n-   Wear a disposable face mask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the person's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.\r\n    \r\n\r\n  - Throw out disposable face masks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.\r\n    \r\n  -   First remove and throw away gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and throw away the face mask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\r\n    \r\n\r\n-   Do not share household items such as dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the person who is sick. After the person uses these items, wash them thoroughly.\r\n    \r\n-   Clean all \"high-touch\" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe.\r\n    \r\n-   Wash laundry thoroughly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n  -   Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.\r\n    \r\n  -   Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands immediately after removing your gloves.\r\n    \r\n\r\n-   Place all used disposable gloves, face masks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items",

Put together a single list of emergency contacts for their (and your) reference, including doctors, family members, neighbors, and friends. Include contact information for their local public health department.\r\n\nYou can also help them to plan ahead. For example, ask your parents to give their neighbors or friends a set of house keys. \n\nHave them stock up on prescription and over-the counter medications, health and emergency medical supplies, and nonperishable food and household supplies.

But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service.",

While these are only observations and not based on scientific studies, it currently seems prudent to use acetaminophen to help reduce fever and ease aches and pains related to this coronavirus infection. No specific recommendation was made regarding naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Given naproxen and ibuprofen have similar actions, it's best to avoid naproxen as well. For now, if you suspect or know you have COVID-19 and cannot take acetaminophen, or have taken the maximum dose and still need symptom relief, contact your doctor for advice.",

Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.",

Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.",

Contacts can be anyone who has been in contact with an infected person: family members, work colleagues, friends, or health care providers.\n\nContact listing: All persons considered to have contact with the infected person should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be made to identify every listed contact and to inform them of their contact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. Contacts should also be provided with information about prevention of the disease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high risk contacts, either at home, or in hospital.\n\nContact follow-up: Regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection.",

There are many examples of temporary shortness of breath that are not worrisome. For example, if you feel very anxious, it's common to get short of breath and then it goes away when you calm down.\nHowever, if you find that you are ever breathing harder or having trouble getting air each time you exert yourself, you always need to call your doctor. That was true before we had the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and it will still be true after it is over.\nMeanwhile, it's important to remember that if shortness of breath is your only symptom, without a cough or fever, something other than COVID-19 is the likely problem.",

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",
