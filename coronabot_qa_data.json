		"Sample_Question": "What is a herd immunity?",
		"Answer_Title": "Herd immunity",
		"Answer": "Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or social immunity) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through infection or vaccination, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune.In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease. The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with an infectious individual.",

		"Answer_Title": "Contact Tracing",
		"Answer": "People in close contact with someone who is infected with a virus like COVID-19, are at higher risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially further infecting others. Closely watching these contacts after exposure to an infected person will help the contacts to get care and treatment, and will prevent further transmission of the virus. This monitoring process is called contact tracing, which can be broken down into 3 basic steps: Contact identification: Once someone is confirmed as infected with a virus, contacts are identified by asking about the person’s activities and the activities and roles of the people around them since onset of illness. Contacts can be anyone who has been in contact with an infected person: family members, work colleagues, friends, or health care providers. Contact listing: All persons considered to have contact with the infected person should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be made to identify every listed contact and to inform them of their contact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. Contacts should also be provided with information about prevention of the disease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high risk contacts, either at home, or in hospital. Contact follow-up: Regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection",

		"Answer_Title": "Shortness of breath and Covid19",
		"Answer": "Shortness of breath refers to unexpectedly feeling out of breath, or winded. But when should you worry about shortness of breath? There are many examples of temporary shortness of breath that are not worrisome. For example, if you feel very anxious, it's common to get short of breath and then it goes away when you calm down. However, if you find that you are ever breathing harder or having trouble getting air each time you exert yourself, you always need to call your doctor. That was true before we had the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and it will still be true after it is over. Meanwhile, it's important to remember that if shortness of breath is your only symptom, without a cough or fever, something other than COVID-19 is the likely problem.",

		"Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, difficulty in breathing and dry cough. Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",

Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. 2). It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. 3). In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.",

Provisional research from Germany has suggested that COVID-19 infectiousness – in contrast to the 2003 SARS outbreak – peaks early and that recovering patients with mild symptoms become low-risk around 10 days after they first fall ill. But another study, following four medical professionals treated at a Wuhan hospital, revealed that traces of the virus could persist in the body for up to two weeks after symptoms had vanished; as the patients were no longer coughing or sneezing, the potential means of transmission were albeit much reduced.",

COVID-19 the disease is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Viruses, and the diseases they cause, often have different names.  For example, HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  People often know the name of a disease, such as measles, but not the name of the virus that causes it (rubeola). There are different processes, and purposes, for naming viruses and diseases. Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).",

		"Answer": "Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that thrive in many different types of environments. Some varieties live in extremes of cold or heat. Others make their home in people's intestines, where they help digest food. Most bacteria cause no harm to people, but there are exceptions. Infections caused by bacteria include:Strep throat,Tuberculosis,Urinary tract infections,Inappropriate use of antibiotics has helped create bacterial diseases that are resistant to treatment with different types of antibiotic medications.\nViruses are even smaller than bacteria and require living hosts — such as people, plants or animals — to multiply. Otherwise, they can't survive. When a virus enters your body, it invades some of your cells and takes over the cell machinery, redirecting it to produce the virus. Diseases caused by viruses include: Chickenpox, AIDS, Common colds. In some cases, it may be difficult to determine whether a bacterium or a virus is causing your symptoms. Many ailments — such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhea — can be caused by either bacteria or viruses.",

		"Answer": "MERS-CoV is a viral respiratory disease that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to more than 27 other countries, according to the World Health Organization. Some people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. From its emergence through December 2019, WHO has confirmed 2,499 MERS cases and 861 deaths (or about 1 in 3). Among all reported cases in people, about 80% have occurred in Saudi Arabia. Only two patients in the United States have tested positive for MERS-CoV, both of whom recovered. They were healthcare providers who lived in Saudi Arabia, where they likely were infected before traveling to the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\nInfection with SARS-CoV can cause a severe viral respiratory illness. SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003, though cases subsequently were tracked to late 2002. SARS quickly spread to about two dozen countries before being contained after about four months. Since 2004, there have been no known SARS cases.",

		"Answer_Title": "Decision",
		"Answer": "Isolation is used to separate ill persons who have a communicable disease from those who are healthy. Isolation restricts the movement of ill persons to help stop the spread of certain diseases. For example, hospitals use isolation for patients with infectious tuberculosis.Quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of well persons who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill. These people may have been exposed to a disease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms. Quarantine can also help limit the spread of communicable disease.",

		"Answer": "MERS-CoV is a viral respiratory disease that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to more than 27 other countries, according to the World Health Organization. Some people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. From its emergence through December 2019, WHO has confirmed 2,499 MERS cases and 861 deaths (or about 1 in 3). Among all reported cases in people, about 80% have occurred in Saudi Arabia. Only two patients in the United States have tested positive for MERS-CoV, both of whom recovered. They were healthcare providers who lived in Saudi Arabia, where they likely were infected before traveling to the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infection with SARS-CoV can cause a severe viral respiratory illness. SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003, though cases subsequently were tracked to late 2002. SARS quickly spread to about two dozen countries before being contained after about four months. Since 2004, there have been no known SARS cases.",

		"Answer": "(1) Bacterial pneumonia. Common symptoms include coughing, coughing up sputum, or nexacerbation of the original respiratory symptoms, with purulent or bloody sputum, with or without chest pain. It is generally not considered a contagious disease. (2) SARS/MERS. Although the novel coronavirus is in the same family as SARS and MERS coronaviruses, a genetic evolution analysis shows that it belongs to a different branch of the same subgroup. It is neither a SARS nor a MERS virus, based on the viral genomic sequences. Due to the similarities between COVID-19-and SARS/MERS-caused pneumonia, it is challenging to distinguish them with clinical manifestations and imaging results. Therefore, a pathogen identification test by rRT- PCR is needed. (3) Other viral pneumonia. Pneumonia caused by influenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and other coronaviruses.",

Meanwhile, clinicians will primarily test those with respiratory symptoms who have recently traveled to certain countries, live in a community with many infected people, or likely have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. Call the State Helpline Number or Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India's 24x7 helpline 011-2397 8046.

		"Answer": "Follow Five Steps to Wash Your Hands the Right Way  Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.  Follow these five steps every time.  -Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. -Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. -Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the Happy Birthday song from beginning to end twice. -Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. -Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.",

But if that’s not an option, it’s perfectly acceptable to express your concerns to your supervisor or HR team. You could simply say, “I know John is working hard, but it seems like he’s not feeling very well. Is it possible to ask him to work from home until he’s no longer running a fever or coughing? I’m concerned about him infecting others in the office.”  These can feel like awkward conversations to have. But it’s the job of leadership and HR teams to provide a safe work environment to all employees—and they’re trained to address thorny issues like these.",

		"Answer_Title": "Quarantine procedure",
		"Answer": "Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.",

		"Answer": "A specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). The sample is delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test. The number of tests and testing sites available are rapidly increasing. Still, it will take weeks before the test is available to everyone who may be infected. Meanwhile, clinicians will primarily test those with respiratory symptoms who have recently traveled to certain countries, live in a community with many infected people, or likely have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. Call the State Helpline Number or Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India's 24 x7 helpline 011 - 2397 8046. If one qualifies as acase for testing as per the protocol,they would be tested at a Government approved lab only.",

Follow these five steps every time.    -Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.  -Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.  -Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.  -Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.  -Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.",

Step 2 in the picture shows how this looks.This glov is for your dominant hand (the one you write with). Be careful to touch just the inside of the cuff and glove. This part will touch your skin when the glove is on your hand. -Let the glove hang with the fingers pointing downward. Then slide your dominant hand into the glove with your palm facing up and your fingers open. Step 3 in the picture shows how this looks. Be careful not to touch the package as you put on the gloves. -If the glove does not go on straight, wait to adjust it until you put on the other glove. Keep your hands above your waist to make sure they stay sterile. -Use the hand with the glove to slide your fingers under the cuff of the second glove. Step 4 in the picture shows how this looks. Only touch the outside of this glove. This part will not be against your skin when the glove is on your hand. -Let the glove hang with the fingers pointing downward. Slide your hand into the glove with the palm up and the fingers open. Step 5 in the picture shows how this looks. -Adjust both gloves until they fit properly. Only touch sterile gloved areas.",

Meanwhile, clinicians will primarily test those with respiratory symptoms who have recently traveled to certain countries, live in a community with many infected people, or likely have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. Call the State Helpline Number or Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Indias 24x7 helpline 011-2397 8046.

Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and dont feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",

But if that’s not an option, it’s perfectly acceptable to express your concerns to your supervisor or HR team. You could simply say, “I know John is working hard, but it seems like he’s not feeling very well. Is it possible to ask him to work from home until he’s no longer running a fever or coughing? I’m concerned about him infecting others in the office.”  These can feel like awkward conversations to have. But it’s the job of leadership and HR teams to provide a safe work environment to all employees—and they’re trained to address thorny issues like these.",

Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.  Follow these five steps every time.  Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.",

		"Answer_Title": "Chlorine as disinfectant",
		"Answer": "Chlorine solutions should be prepared fresh daily, as they are light sensitive. Most chlorine products require the removal of organic soil prior to their use (removing bulk spill matter, cleaning prior to disinfecting). Disinfection requires a wet contact time (amount of time the disinfectant is required to be left on the surface to be effective). Chlorine odor does not necessarily indicate appropriate solution strength, since chlorine odor can be detected even at extremely low concentrations. Chlorine solutions are corrosive and can pit metal and damage skin.",

		"Answer": "Some viruses are extremely stable under soil conditions. In general, virus survival in soils depends mostly on temperature and virion adsorption to soil (sand and clay colloids). Other influential factors include soil moisture content, presence of aerobic microorganisms, levels of resin-extractable phosphorous, exchangeable aluminum, organic matter, and soil pH. TMV (Virgaviridae), for instance, remains infectious in soil for several years in living or dead plant debris.",

		"Answer": "Isolation is used to separate ill persons who have a communicable disease from those who are healthy. Isolation restricts the movement of ill persons to help stop the spread of certain diseases. For example, hospitals use isolation for patients with infectious tuberculosis. Social distancing is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention implemented to avoid/decrease contact between those who are infected with a disease causing pathogen and those who are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease transmission in a community. This eventually leads to decrease in spread, morbidity and mortality due to the disease.",

		"Answer": "Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that thrive in many different types of environments. Some varieties live in extremes of cold or heat. Others make their home in peoples intestines, where they help digest food. Most bacteria cause no harm to people, but there are exceptions. Infections caused by bacteria include: Strep throat Tuberculosis Urinary tract infections Inappropriate use of antibiotics has helped create bacterial diseases that are resistant to treatment with different types of antibiotic medications.  Viruses are even smaller than bacteria and require living hosts — such as people, plants or animals — to multiply. Otherwise, they cant survive. When a virus enters your body, it invades some of your cells and takes over the cell machinery, redirecting it to produce the virus. Diseases caused by viruses include: Chickenpox AIDS Common colds In some cases, it may be difficult to determine whether a bacterium or a virus is causing your symptoms. Many ailments — such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhea — can be caused by either bacteria or viruses. ",

		"Answer_Title": "Comparison",
		"Answer": "-A face mask is a loose fitting mask that covers the nose and mouth area. They have 2 ear loops that stretch around the ears to hold the mask in place. Face mask are designed to be used as ONE-WAY PROTECTION ONLY, only capturing large particles or droplets exiting from the wearer and preventing them from being spread to the environment. Typically used to prevent the spread of common colds and flus. Contrary to belief, face mask DO NOT protect the wearer at all. Typically most face mask do not have any protection factor assigned to them and are not NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health) approved apparatus. They are only recommended as a precautionary measure to protect the people around you.  -A respirator is a tight fitting mask that creates a FACIAL SEAL. Each respirator when used properly will create a facial seal which will provide TWO-WAY PROTECTION, filtering the air entering and exiting the wearer at a level of efficiency designated by the respirator or filter/cartridge (Half Face and Full Face). Respirators come in 3 distinct categories:  Disposable (typically N95 and healthcare uses) Half Face  Full Face",

		"Answer": "A respirator is a masklike device, usually of gauze, worn over the mouth, or nose and mouth, to prevent the inhalation of noxious substances or the like. Health professionals wear respirators to filter out virus particles as they breathe in so they don’t get infected with COVID-19 while helping people and patients.  The CDC specifically recommends health professionals using what are called N95 respirators. This type of respirator fits more tightly around the nose and mouth than regular medical or surgical masks. Another type of respirator is known as PAPR, short for powered air-purifying respirators, which covers the whole head and uses a blower to filter air.",

		"Answer_Title": "Flattening the Curve",
		"Answer": "The WHO has repeatedly underlined the importance of “flattening the curve” in order to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, calling on countries around the world to impose sweeping public health measures. In epidemiology, the curve refers to the projected number of new cases over a period of time. In contrast to a steep rise of coronavirus infections, a more gradual uptick of cases will see the same number of people get infected, but without overburdening the health-care system at any one time. The idea of flattening the curve is to stagger the number of new cases over a longer period, so that people have better access to care.",

		"Answer": "Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, and Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t make you sick. Some vaccines contain only a part of the disease germ. A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. This is what makes vaccines such powerful medicine. Unlike most medicines, which treat or cure diseases, vaccines prevent them.",
