        "Answer":"Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or social immunity) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through infection or vaccination, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune.In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease. The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with an infectious individual.",

        "Answer_Title":"Contact Tracing",
        "Answer":"People in close contact with someone who is infected with a virus like COVID-19, are at higher risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially further infecting others. Closely watching these contacts after exposure to an infected person will help the contacts to get care and treatment, and will prevent further transmission of the virus. This monitoring process is called contact tracing, which can be broken down into 3 basic steps: Contact identification: Once someone is confirmed as infected with a virus, contacts are identified by asking about the person’s activities and the activities and roles of the people around them since onset of illness. Contacts can be anyone who has been in contact with an infected person: family members, work colleagues, friends, or health care providers. Contact listing: All persons considered to have contact with the infected person should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be made to identify every listed contact and to inform them of their contact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. Contacts should also be provided with information about prevention of the disease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high risk contacts, either at home, or in hospital. Contact follow-up: Regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection",

        "Answer":"Shortness of breath refers to unexpectedly feeling out of breath, or winded. But when should you worry about shortness of breath? There are many examples of temporary shortness of breath that are not worrisome. For example, if you feel very anxious, it's common to get short of breath and then it goes away when you calm down. However, if you find that you are ever breathing harder or having trouble getting air each time you exert yourself, you always need to call your doctor. That was true before we had the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and it will still be true after it is over. Meanwhile, it's important to remember that if shortness of breath is your only symptom, without a cough or fever, something other than COVID-19 is the likely problem.",

Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",

The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly. The results provide key information about the stability of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, and suggests that people may acquire the virus through the air and after touching contaminated objects.",

        "Answer":"1). Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. 2). It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. 3). In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.",

        "Answer":"To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.",

Provisional research from Germany has suggested that COVID-19 infectiousness – in contrast to the 2003 SARS outbreak – peaks early and that recovering patients with mild symptoms become low-risk around 10 days after they first fall ill. But another study, following four medical professionals treated at a Wuhan hospital, revealed that traces of the virus could persist in the body for up to two weeks after symptoms had vanished; as the patients were no longer coughing or sneezing, the potential means of transmission were albeit much reduced.",

        "Answer":"Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that thrive in many different types of environments. Some varieties live in extremes of cold or heat. Others make their home in people's intestines, where they help digest food. Most bacteria cause no harm to people, but there are exceptions. Infections caused by bacteria include:Strep throat,Tuberculosis,Urinary tract infections,Inappropriate use of antibiotics has helped create bacterial diseases that are resistant to treatment with different types of antibiotic medications.\nViruses are even smaller than bacteria and require living hosts — such as people, plants or animals — to multiply. Otherwise, they can't survive. When a virus enters your body, it invades some of your cells and takes over the cell machinery, redirecting it to produce the virus. Diseases caused by viruses include: Chickenpox, AIDS, Common colds. In some cases, it may be difficult to determine whether a bacterium or a virus is causing your symptoms. Many ailments — such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhea — can be caused by either bacteria or viruses.",

        "Answer":"(1) Bacterial pneumonia. Common symptoms include coughing, coughing up sputum, or nexacerbation of the original respiratory symptoms, with purulent or bloody sputum, with or without chest pain. It is generally not considered a contagious disease. (2) SARS/MERS. Although the novel coronavirus is in the same family as SARS and MERS coronaviruses, a genetic evolution analysis shows that it belongs to a different branch of the same subgroup. It is neither a SARS nor a MERS virus, based on the viral genomic sequences. Due to the similarities between COVID-19-and SARS/MERS-caused pneumonia, it is challenging to distinguish them with clinical manifestations and imaging results. Therefore, a pathogen identification test by rRT- PCR is needed. (3) Other viral pneumonia. Pneumonia caused by influenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and other coronaviruses.",

However, similar to treatment of any viral infection, these measures can help: While you don't need to stay in bed, you should get plenty of rest. Stay well hydrated. Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen to reduce fever and ease aches and pains. Be sure to follow directions. If you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep track of all the ingredients and the doses.

In general, its incidence peaks in autumn and winter. Human influenza is mainly caused by influenza A virus and influenza B virus. Influenza A viruses often undergo antigen mutations and can be further classified into subtypes such as H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9. When new influenza virus subtypes appear, they easily become a pandemic because the population generally lacks immunity against them.",

The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly.There's a lot we still don't know, such as how different conditions, such as exposure to sunlight, heat, or cold, can affect these survival times.",

Follow these five steps every time.  -Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. -Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. -Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the Happy Birthday song from beginning to end twice. -Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. -Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.",
